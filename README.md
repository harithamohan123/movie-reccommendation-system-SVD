 # Movie Recommendation System using singlular value decomposition
 
 In this project, we use singlular value decomposition for generating / creating a movie recommendation system.                           

Procedure:                                                                                                                  
=> Analyse the problem that is need to be found, here we need to identify similar movies.                                           
=> Importing and parsing dataset as ratings and movies detials.                                                                                       
=> Create a recommendation system with collabrative-filtering (This approach is builds models based on past behaviour of users).                     
=> Create rating matix of shape(m x u).                                                                                                   
=> Subtract mean off commonly known as normalization.                                                                       
=> Computing Singular Value Decomposition.                                                                                
=> Calculate cosine similarity, sort the most similarity, sort by most similar and return the top N.                                           
=> This shows the top most n similar movies for the users.
